States:
- Danger: avoid explosion path of placed bomb
  - Detect by scanning in all 4 directions from this player for bombs with no walls in between
  - keep track of which bombs were but down by this player and their bomb radius to allow avoiding a bomb by just moving far enough away from it
  - could try to keep track of which players placed each bomb and the bomb radius for each player to allow avoidance by moving far enough away
  - simple avoidance would be a breadth first search from the player to the nearest accessible cell that no bomb explosion will cover
- Avoidance: avoid getting cornered by another player
- Attack: place a bomb to try to kill another player
- Mine: place a bomb to destroy rocks for items
- Gather: try to collect an accessible powerup


Additional data to keep track of:
- which player placed each bomb
- turn number on which each bomb was placed
- bomb radius of other players
- which cells will blow up from a placed bomb (for bomb avoidance)
- which cells are normally accessible to this player (i.e. no rocks in the way)

Skills:
- path finder: find the shortest path to get to a cell (e.g. to collect a powerup)
- breadth first search: find the closest path that means a criteria (e.g. safe from explosion)

Milestones:
+ random movement
+ smooth movements (avoid unnecessary backtracking)
- place bomb if escape plan exists
- avoid bomb's explosion path
